- `/profit`: Lists cumulative profit from all finished trades

## Development branches

The project is currently setup in two main branches:

- `develop` - This branch has often new features, but might also contain breaking changes. We try hard to keep this branch as stable as possible.
- `stable` - This branch contains the latest stable release. This branch is generally well tested.
- `feat/*` - These are feature branches, which are being worked on heavily. Please don't use these unless you want to test a specific feature.



**Important:** Always create your PR against the `develop` branch, not `stable`.
